# Janilla PetClinic Sample Application

## What's this?

This is a Janilla version of the Spring PetClinic official sample application by [Spring](https://spring.io/).

The original application lives at <https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic>.

## Understanding the PetClinic application

A database-oriented application designed to display and manage information related to pets and veterinarians in a pet clinic.

## Run PetClinic locally

Janilla PetClinic is a [Janilla](https://janilla.com/) application built using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/users/index.html). You can run it from Maven directly (it should work just as well with Java 21 or newer):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diego-schivo/janilla-petclinic.git
cd janilla-petclinic
mvn compile exec:java
```

You can then access the PetClinic at <https://localhost:8443/>.

You can change the file location by editing `configuration.properties` in the source package.
